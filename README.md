# Casper.com Clone Project

Welcome to the Casper.com clone project repository! Here, we're recreating the Casper website (casper.com), one step at a time.

## A Bit of History

Originally, it began as a project for the freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. However, We soon realized that there's more joy in creating something real and meaningful than simply checking off requirements.

## What's Inside?

So far, we've built the skeleton of our clone, featuring a top bar, a navigation bar, and the beginnings of our main content section. It's a humble start, but we're excited to see where this project takes us.

## Why Are We Doing This?

Our main goal is to explore front-end web development by recreating a real-world website like Casper. We hope to sharpen our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this hands-on learning experience.

## What's Next?

We're currently focused on perfecting the static front page with one or two level links to other pages. While we have future plans outlined below, we're also keen on refining the details. Whether it's incorporating more elaborate animations, enhancing the design, or delving into dynamic web development. It's endless possibilities.

But for now, let's focus on building the foundation and enjoying the journey!

## Personal Learning Objectives

In addition to gaining proficiency in web technologies like HTML/CSS and Javascript, we aim to explore GitHub's features, starting with pull requests and issues. If we misuse any GitHub features, please don't hesitate to point it out.

## Upcoming Initiatives

#### - Tutorials and Example Codes: 

As individuals new to the world of programming, we understand the challenges of deciphering unfamiliar code. To address this, we believe that clear explanations for every part of the code are essential for a fruitful learning experience.

Our aim is to ensure clarity in every aspect of our code. Currently, we're considering creating tutorial files in markdown format in one folder and storing additional examples in a separate folder, but we are open to suggestions.

#### - Make It Full-stack
 Transition the project into a full-stack application with Django.

## Join Us! 

This project is open to contributions from everyone. If you are just starting out, let's learn together. Pros, your advice and tips, however small, are truly appreciated 

## Archived Version

As we're cloning the website at a specific point in time, we've created an archived version of the original Casper website using archive.org for future reference.

You can access the archived version of the Casper website [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240513151818/https://casper.com/).
